#### Directory and File Explanation 

Root Directory

.gitignore: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.
README.md: Provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, and usage examples.
requirements.txt: Lists all the Python dependencies required for the project.
setup.py: Contains metadata about the project and is used for distributing the package.
repository_structure.txt: A generated file that provides a snapshot of the current project structure.

src/repo_analyzer/
This directory contains the core functionality of the project.

__init__.py: Initializes the repo_analyzer package.
analyzer.py: Contains the main logic for analyzing GitHub repositories.
github_api.py: Handles interactions with the GitHub API to fetch repository data.
json_converter.py: Manages conversion between different data formats, primarily to and from JSON.
utils.py: Provides utility functions used across the project.

tests/
This directory contains all the unit tests for the project.

__init__.py: Initializes the tests package.
test_analyzer.py: Contains tests for the main analyzer functionality.
test_github_api.py: Tests the GitHub API interaction functions.
test_json_converter.py: Ensures correct data conversion functionality.

examples/
This directory provides example scripts to demonstrate how to use the project.

analyze_example_repo.py: A sample script showing how to analyze a GitHub repository using this tool.

web/
This directory contains files related to the web interface of the project.

app.py: The main Flask application file that serves the web interface.
templates/index.html: The HTML template for the main page of the web interface.
static/css/style.css: Contains CSS styles for the web interface.
static/js/main.js: Contains JavaScript code for the web interface.

Purpose of Each Script

github_api.py: This script is responsible for interacting with the GitHub API. It handles authentication, fetches repository structures, and retrieves repository information. Its main purpose is to provide a clean interface for accessing GitHub data, abstracting away the complexities of API calls and data parsing.
analyzer.py: This script contains the core logic for analyzing GitHub repositories. It processes the data fetched by github_api.py and performs various analyses such as directory structure evaluation, file type statistics, and potentially more complex metrics like code complexity or contribution patterns.
json_converter.py: This utility script handles the conversion of data structures to and from JSON format. It's crucial for data serialization, especially when storing analysis results or preparing data for the web interface.
utils.py: This script contains various utility functions used throughout the project. These might include helper functions for file operations, data processing, or any other common tasks that don't fit specifically into the other modules.
app.py: This is the main file for the web interface. It sets up a Flask server, defines routes, and handles requests. It integrates the analyzer functionality with a user-friendly web interface, allowing users to input repository URLs and view analysis results.
analyze_example_repo.py: This example script demonstrates how to use the repo analyzer in a standalone Python script. It serves as both documentation and a starting point for users who want to integrate the analyzer into their own projects.
